                Lived in a tropical and warm climate with lots of vegetation
                containing lots of herbivore dinosaurs for the giganotosaurus to prey on.
                The giganotosaurus lived near the coastal plains and inland areas, using the
                environment for both food and water.

                The giganotosaurus measured to be about 41 feet meters long with a staggering height
                of 23 feet high and also weighing about 8.8 tons at max.
                This dinosaur had 76 teeth with each tooth being 8 inches long.

                Most of the dinosaur fossils were found in Argentina, however this isn’t official,

                The giganototsaurus lived aduring the early Cretaceous (Mesozoic Era) about 145-66 million
                years ago. This meant that this apex predator never came into contact with a T-Rex.

                </header>

                <p> The giganotosaurus was discovered by Rubén Dario Carolini in the Neuquén Province of
                    Patagonia (southern Argentina) after he stumbled upon the lower leg bone of the dino.
                    After being classified as a new genus and species, it was named Giganotosaurus carolinii.

                </header>

                <p> Somewhat similar to the T-Rex and also related to other theropods, the giganotosaurus walked
                    on two strong hind limbs, also being able to run at 31 mph. It also had an abnormally large head
                    containing razor sharp teeth as well as 3 razor claws.

                <p>
                    The giganotosaurus can be identified by its large and elongated skull compared to the T-Rex.
                    The skull of a giganotosaurus was unique as it had a low skull with a deep 92 cm long upper jaw.
                    It also had a chin displayed as its lower jaw.

                <p>
                    The giganotosaurus preyed on larger herbivores such as sauropods because there was an
                    abundance of herbivores during the Late Cretaceous era, due to the vegetation abundance.

                        When hunting the, the giganotosaurus was an apex predator that hunted in packs or as
                        solitary predators. Unlike the T-Rex, the giganotosaurus adapted to have a good sense of
                        smell
                        and
                        vision.
                        It also used its environment to ambush prey, since their habitat could keep them hidden.

                        it was vulnerable to larger dinos such as a Carnotaurus. When the giga grew to an adult
                        it became an
                        apex predator that didn’t live near or ever come into contact with another dangerous
                        apex predator.

                    <p>The stegosaurus is one of the most well known dinosaurs, it lived during the Jurassic period and was a
                    not so gentle giant. With the average dimensions of 8-10 meters long and with a weight of up to 6 tons,
                    this dinosaur was no easy task to take down. Using its powerful tail, it defended itself from predators,
                    and it was very effective at that due to the spike on the end of their tails. The plates on the
                    stegosaurus’s back were not used as armor as originally thought, instead they were used in order to
                    regulate body temperature. The most impressive part about the stegosaurus was their diet, daily they
                    would consume upwards of 500 pounds of vegetation.

            <h2>Discoverer</h2>
            <p>In 1877, Othniel Charles Marsh<sup>[<a href="#source1">1</a>]</sup> dug up the Stegosaurus Armatus in the
                Rocky Mountains, USA. There were many misconceptions about the stegosaurus until more fossils were dug
                up. Originally there were many species of stegosaurus, however it was later discovered that they were
                all the same species, yet with different genuses.</p>

            <h2>Fossil Record</h2>
            <p>The first partial skeleton of a stegosaurus was found in the UK in 1874<sup>[<a href="#source2">2</a>]</sup>, however partial skeletons have
                been found from Europe, to Asia, to North America! There were many fossils dug up in the following years
                and decades, however those dug up close to the first discovery of the stegosaurus were often confused
                for a new species. These fossils were later identified as stegosaurus however some were different
                genomes.</p>
            <p>When stegosaurus fossils were discovered, the plates on their back were originally thought to have laid
                flat on their back, acting as armor. However once preserved upright plates were dug up, it was later
                determined that the plates were vertical<sup>[<a href="#source3">3</a>]</sup>. Perhaps they helped regulate body temperature, however much is
                still unknown. </p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <section>
                <p>The stegosaurus fossils are commonly found in environments that would have been woodlands or fern
                    dominated environments in the Jurassic period. Today those places would be the central section of
                    North America, parts of Europe and Asia. For context this could be Colorado or Wyoming in the US. For reference, These would similar habitats such as those in which the mountain lions live in.

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>The stegosaurus was a herbivore, meaning it only consumed plants for its energy intake. Given the
                dinosaur’s massive size, they required lots and lots of food everyday, estimates range from 150 pounds
                to 700 pounds of vegetation each day. </p>

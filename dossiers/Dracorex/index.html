            <p>The Dracorex are known for their unique skull but they are pretty average sized dinosaurs. They spanned
                from 10-12 feet in length and 4-5 feet in height. The Dracorex weighed about 500 pounds which is about
                the weight of a full grown grizzly bear.

            <h2 class="seven">Behaviors and Survival</h2>
            <p >The Dracorex were rather aggresive creatures who were extremely territorial. They lived in groups of
                about 4-5 istead of staying in a big group.Due to their extreme territorial
                instincts, the Dracorex would often exert dominance by getting into headbutt fights with their sharp,
                boney skulls. These were mainly the males. They communicated both verbally and with motions with their
                head.</p>

        <h2 class="nine">Fossils</h2>
        <p>The Dracorex has an extraordinary skull. That is how it got its name "Dragon King". Just like all
            Pachycephalosaurs, they don't have an average dome-shaped skull. The Dracorex's skull is extremely boney and
            pointy resembling the head of a dragon. The Dracorex was discovered by three amatuer paleontologists but it
            wasn't until 2006 when it was named by Bob Bakker and Robert Sullivan. The name may sound familiar and its
            true! It is related to Harry Potter and it is latin for Dragon King Hogwartsia. One complete Dracorex skull
            has been discovered. This finding included the skull along with 4 cervical vertabrae's. The atlas, third,
            and also the ninth.</p>

            <h2 class="eleven">When and Where</h2>
            <p>66 million years ago the Dracorex roamed the earth. They existed during the Mesozoic era during the late
                Cretaceous time period. They lived alongside other dinosaurs such as the Hadrosaur Edmontosaur,
                Ceratopian Triceratops and Torosaurus, Armored Ankylosaurus, Ornomomithid Struthiomimus, Therapods
                Troodon, and the T-rex. They tend to live around other herbivorous dinosaurs in places that consist of
                heavy vegetation such as the woodlands, forests, and swamps. They Dracorex mainly populated what is now
                considered modern day North America and roamed around Iowa, Montana, and South Dakota in their small
                groups. </p>

            <h2 class="thirteen">Diet</h2>
            <p> There is a debate between whether or not the Dracorex were omnivores or herbivores. The truth is, they
                were omnivores. Although their diet consisted mainly of vegetation rather than meat. They would
                occasionally eat little animals and bugs such as bugs and lizards. The Dracorex consumes about one fifth
                of their body weight in food every single day. That is about 100 pounds of food a day.</p>

            <h2 class="fifteen">Predators</h2>
            <p> The main predators of the Dracorex were raptors and the tyrannosaurus rex. Their skull helped them fight
                off predators. It came in extremely handy for these dinosaurs. Not only did it help make them
                intimidating to other dinosaurs but it helped them fight back since their skull is so sharp.</p>

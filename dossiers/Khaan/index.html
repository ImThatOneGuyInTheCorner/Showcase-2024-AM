            Khaan mckennai, a dinosaur discovered in 2001 by James M. Clark in the Woodlands of the Nemegt Basin in
            Mongolia, which is located in central Asia.
            Khaan had a maximum size of approximately 110 centimeters long (around 6 feet).
            This small theropod dinosaur resembles a small bird-like creature that has feathers.
            It likely had a carnivorous diet, primarily consisting of small vertebrates such as mammals, lizards, and
            possibly other small dinosaurs.
            Khaan was an egg-layer and showed nesting behaviors.
            The exact vocalization abilities of Khaan are not known, some theropods may have used their mouths to make
            noise as a means of communication with each other.</span>

                <p> Regarding its fossil records, three total fossils of Khaan Mckennai have been discovered, including
                    elements such as skulls, vertebrae, limbs, claws, feathers, and egg fragments.
                    These fossils provide valuable insights into the anatomy and characteristics of this dinosaur,
                    helping scientists determine that it was most likely an agile and active predator.</p>

    <h2>Predator</h2>

        <p>Although there is no direct evidence for predators the Khaan would have faced, based on educated guesses of
            known predators who had lived in the area.
            Khaan was a small dinosaur, it would have been vulnerable to predators of larger theropods such as the
            Tarbosaurus.</p>

    <h2>Life cycle</h2>
    <section class="four-thirds">
        <p>The life cycle of Khaan mckennai followed a pattern common among many dinosaurs.
            It began as an egg. In their juvenile stage, they are raised by their parents, growing and developing their
            skills. As sub-adults, they gain independence from their parents.
            Adulthood, Khaan are fully capable predators, hunting small vertebrates.
            They find a mate and this life cycle repeats.</p>

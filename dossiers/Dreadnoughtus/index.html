                <h2>Classification</h2>
                <p>This big monster weighs about 65 tons at a towering height of 85 ft. <sup>[<a href="#Source01">1</a>]</sup> He is the Genus of a Titanosaurian Sauropod Dinosaur,
                     aka a subclass of the big dino<sup>[<a href="#Source01">2</a>]</sup>, hence his behemoth-like size and height in the picture and his measurements above.
                      The big guy is a part of the Animalia kingdom as he too is a victim of the cycle of life. 
                      His hay day was around the Late Cretaceous Period, about 76-70 million years ago. 
                      Lastly, his hood is in Argentina in South America, as where his fossil was located.
                </p>

                <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
                <p>Not much is known about how The Dreadnoughtus acts, but some have said that his movements and manuerisms were similar to that of an Elephant,
                     which is usually quite peaceful unless disturbed and provoked. Since this guy was too big to really eat anything meat related.
                      His diet is all carnivorous, this big guy likes to chow down on plant life.

                <figcaption>This is a picture of a Tree, Since The Dreadnoughtus neck is so long
                    It implies that he had to reach high places, or low areas to get his much on.

            <h2>Little Rundown of His Opps</h2>
            <p>Hence the big guy’s Immense size, many possible predators wouldn’t dare take him on. 
                But there were much smaller dinosaurs who actively engaged with this larger than life creature,
                 some being Theropods as the analysis of the fossil, the researchers found marks on its legs and feet.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p> The Velociraptor was a dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia around the Late Cretaceous
                        epoch, about
                        75 million to 71 million years ago.
                        It survived by feeding on smaller and/or slower prey. It was known by its classic sickled toes
                        (shown in
                        picture) which were strong that it used
                        against its prey. There are two main species of Vilociraptors,<sup><a

                    <p>
                        Velociraptors mostly lived in
                        desert climates, mainly the gobi desert in Mongolia with a climate that had some but few trees
                        and shrubs and greenery. There were also some streams that provided them with water. They
                        usually stay
                        ed alone and in the same place

                    <h2>Identification</h2>
                    <p>
                        To identify a Velociraptor, you can distinguish it by its razor-sharp teeth, upturned nose, 
                        short and athletic body, and the renowned sickle claw, often referred to as the "killer claw,"
                         making it easily recognizable among dinosaurs. Additionally, Velociraptors were smaller than 
                         their Hollywood depiction in "Jurassic Park," typically the size of a turkey.

                            The fossil record is like a view of the past, because we found a majority of its fossils 
                            in Mongolia and China, which shows us the age of these dinosaurs, which are pretty old. The
                             most significant part of these fossils was the famous sickle claw that they had. This tells 
                             us that they were small, feathered, and bird-like. These fossils helped us learn more about
                              these dinosaurs and where they came from.

                        <p>
                            The Velociraptor was discorerd by Peter Kaisen 
                            during an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Flaming Cliffs 
                            of the Djadokhta Formation, Gobi Desert. On the 11th of August
                            1923, he discovered the first Velociraptor fossil known to science with a
                            crushed but complete skull, associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws (sickle claw).

                        <p>
                            Velociraptors are believed to have primarily preyed on small lizards, mammals, and potentially even 
                            baby dinosaurs and their eggs as part of their diet. Their sharp teeth and large, sickle-shaped claws 
                            were well-suited for hunting and capturing such smaller prey, which likely constituted a significant 
                            portion of their food sources during the Late Cretaceous period.

                        <p>
                          Despite how they hae been potrayed in media, Velociraptors are not the pack hunting, killling machines that
                          we think they are. These dinosaurs were most likely solitary animals who hunted alone and lived off of small easier to catch 
                          prey. They were agile and athletic, able to move quickly because of there small build. They also scavenged when they got the chance even tho 
                          they were not primarily scavengers

                                There isnt much evidence on how Velociraptors comunicated due to the scarce fossil record. 
                                However scientists have found that these animals had bird like characteristics and most likely 
                                comunicated as such. They likely communicated through vocalizations, body language, and
                                 possibly visual displays. Vocalizations might have included calls, chirps, or hisses to convey
                                 information or warnings.

                                The Velociraptor life cycle was very similar to birds and reptiles. They started as babys, born from eggs and werre 
                                cared for by there mothers. They grew up quickly and learned the skills needed for life. Once our on there own the would live
                                normally and eventually reproduce and pass away.

                              Velociraptors breeded much like modern day birds and reptiles using eggs as there way of reproducing. these eggs were 
                              protected and the offspring were fed and nurished.

                                The Velociraptor was a small agile and fast animal but was not free from predetors. Even though they were fast, they were weak compared 
                                to other dinosaurs such as the Tyranasauras Rex or the "terror Birds" that roamed at this time.

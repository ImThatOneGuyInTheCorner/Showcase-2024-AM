                    <h2>Habitat</h2>
                    <p>The Brachiosaurus lived in grasslands and marshes as their only source of food was vegatation. It
                        was first actually theorized that they lived in water. Their large body was thought to be
                        supported by water and not their small legs. This was proven to be false and that they were
                        actually terrestrial. </p>

                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>Their herbivorous diet required them to eat hundreds of pounds of leaves a day. With such massive
                        bodies and not being meat eaters they had adapted a longer neck to eat the leaves on higher
                        trees without having to even move. The main staple to their diet was ginko leaves and coniferous
                        trees.<sup>[<a title="Enchanted Learning: Brachiosaurus" href="#source1">1</a>]</sup></p>

                    <h2>Adaptations and Behaviors</h2>
                    <p>Their long necks provided them with the ability to eat leaves on higer trees and not even need to
                        move from their spot to eat more leaves. The
                        sheer size of these dinosaurs made them the least likely to be prey. The Brachiosaurus likely
                        traveled in herds which further protected them.<sup>[<a

                <h2>Size Range and Weight</h2>
                <p>The Brachiosaurus was one of the biggest dinosaurs of its time. A real giant among giants. Standing
                    at 40
                    to 50 feet tall they could easily eat leaves from the tallest of trees. Their towering height came
                    with
                    a weight as little as 33 tons to as massive as 88 tons.<sup>[<a
                            title="Enchanted Learning: Brachiosaurus" href="#source1">1</a>]</sup></p>
                <h2>When did it live?</h2>
                <p>They lived in the early to late Jurassic period. This period was around 160 to 140 million years
                    ago.<sup>[<a title="New World Encyclopedia contributor Brachiosaurus" href="#source2">2</a>]</sup>
                    Most
                    of the sauropods were also around at this time such as the Brontosaurus and the Apatosaurus. For
                    some
                    unknown reason the sauropods dwindled and slowly died out during the start of the cretaceous period.

                <h2>Distribution</h2>
                <p>Many of the brachiosaurus fossils were found in Central North America. They were mostly discovered in
                    the Colorado River Valley. It is believed that Colorado was a vast plain during the Jurassic period.
                    A sauropod such as the Brachiosaurus would thrive in that type of environment.<sup>[<a

                <h2>Discovery</h2>
                <p>The Brachiosaurus was discovered in 1900 by Elmer Riggs<sup>[<a
                            title="New World Encyclopedia contributor Brachiosaurus" href="#source2">2</a>]</sup>
                    who also named it in 1903. He found the fossil in the Colorado
                    River Valley where many more Brachiosaurus fossils were found. He named the sauropod after its
                    towering neck and its long front limbs hence the name Arm Lizard.

                <h2>Fossil Identification</h2>
                <p>Its fossil had many unique features such as its many vertebrae. Its skull had wide nose holes that
                    were located to the top of the skull . This feature is why many believed it had lived in water.
                    Their jaws were lined with chisel like teeth. Its front legs were longer than its back legs.<sup>[<a

            <section>
                <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
                <p>Brachiosauruses lived a long life. Up to one hundred years old!<sup>[<a
                            title="Favero, Juliet Thanksgiving Point" href="#source3">3</a>]</sup> They would first
                    start as hatchlings
                    fresh out of their eggs. Then they would grow into juveniles, then sub-adults,  and then finally
                    adults. It’s not exactly known when they become adults but it has been theorized that they would
                    keep growing as sauropods could grow by six pounds a day.</p>

                <h2>Breeding Behavior</h2>
                <p>Not too much is known about these giant’s breeding behaviors. It has been theorized that they do nest
                    together to protect themselves and their offspring.<sup>[<a
                            title="AMNH American Museum of Natural History: Sauropod Dinosaur Babies"
                            href="#source4">4</a>]</sup> They are giant which has led to a lot of
                    speculation on how they actually bred.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Predators</h2>
                <p>There was no real threat to most Brachiosaurus. Unless they were not adults their massive size made
                    them very hard to prey on. Along with this came their natural behaviors of living in a herd.<sup>[<a
                            title="Enchanted Learning: Brachiosaurus" href="#source1">1</a>]</sup> Their
                    leather skin was also hard to tear which provided even more protection.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest speculations to come from dinosaurs is their ways of communicating. The limited
                    evidence of their past only led to speculations and ideas of what they would do. For the
                    Brachiosaurus it was speculated that they made low-frequency sounds. It was also theorized that they
                    would use their long necks as a visual signal.<sup>[<a

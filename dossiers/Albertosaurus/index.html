        <h2>Behavior And Survival</h2>
        <p>
          The Albertosaurus were believed to have traveled and hunted in large
          groups due to large quantities of remains being found within the same
          area, this behavior often resembled pack behavior. They were
          aggressive and dangerous, giving them the crown of Apex Predator.

        <h2>Fossils</h2>
        <p>
          The remains of the Albertosaurus have been dated to be nearly 73.1
          million years old.The Albertosaurus’ remains were first ever
          discovered by a 25 year old man named, Joseph B. Tyrrell. On June 9th
          of 1884, he was actually on an expedition on the search of coal in the
          Horseshoe Canyon Formation of the Red Deer River in Canada.

        <h2>When and Where</h2>
        <p>
          The Albertosaurus thrived in the Late Cretaceous Period, which was
          nearly 70-74 million years ago. This era introduced a variety of
          dinosaurs into the world, that included the Albertosaurus, although
          it’s lifespan was short lived, it was a ferocious apex predator,
          easily dominating its ecosystem. They would primarily prefer to live
          in lush, heavily vegetated semi-tropical environments. Remains having
          been found in Alberta, Canada in areas that used to be floodplains
          that supported large varieties of life nearly 70 million years ago

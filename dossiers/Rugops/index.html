                <h2>Size & Range</h2>
                <p>The size range of the rugops is a length from 4.4 to 5.3 meters with a weight of 410 kilos or 900
                    pounds. They were on the smaller side of dinosaurs. Some are compared to the height of a 
                    human or a little bigger. These dinosaurs were like a pet size of a T-rex. 
                    They had around the same look and little arms. Their arms proposed little to no importance.

                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>They lived in a terrestrial habitat. Terrestrial means on land, like forests, grasslands, deserts,
                    shorelines, and wetlands. Their fossils were found near the Niger in Africa.
                    The Niger was home to many dinosaurs at the time. It offers different habitat types in one area.

                <h2>Identification</h2>
                <p>They are known and identified by their mostly complete skull. The skull is said to be the only fossil
                    and
                    evidence they can find of the Rugops existence.
                    The skull is relatively delicate and has a crest of some kind. The skull can tell scientists a lot
                    of
                    details of how a Rugops lived its life.
                    The delicacy of the skull suggests that they were scavengers and not an attacking type. The skull
                    also
                    bore armor and or scales.

                <h2>Feeding & Diet</h2>
                <p>The Rugops were carnivores. Many think that they weren’t particularly violent and their hunting
                    tactics
                    were different because of their skull structure and adaptations.</p>
                <h3>Behavior and Adaptations</h3>
                <p>Rugops were well-suited for hunting on smaller vertebrates, as well as possibly scavenging larger
                    carcasses when the opportunity came.</p>

                <h2>Life Cycle & History</h2>
                <p>There is no other information about the life cycle of a Rugops dinosaur besides they lived in the
                    late
                    cretaceous period and the only evidence of fossils found is a single skull that is almost complete.
                    There was not much information on their breeding behaviors. When they give birth they lay eggs.

                <h2>Preditors</h2>
                <p>The Rugops shared a habitat with several much bigger dinosaurs which led to them forming packs of 5
                    to 10
                    and living together for safety.
                    At the time they lived with the Spinosaurus, the Carcharodontosaurus, and Sarchosuchus.
                    They might have looked much scarier than they really were.
                    They had a pattern or design on their skin giving it a “warpaint” look that scared other dinosaurs
                    that
                    could be potential predators that were much stronger.

                <h2>Discovery</h2>
                <h3>Time period</h3>
                <p>The dinosaur was discovered by Dr Paul Sereno in the year 2000 and I believe they patented the name
                    in
                    2004.
                    Found near the Niger Republic. Dr. Paul is a paleontologist. He is a professor at the University of
                    Chicago.
                    It lived in the late Cretaceous period. It lived with several other, much larger carnivores such as
                    the
                    Spinosaurus, Sarcosuchus, and Carcharodontosaurus.

                <h2>Fossil Records & Description</h2>
            <p>The skull had armor or scales as well as some type of texture. Many other bones had blood vessels. This
                made
                Dr. Paul Sereno thinks that the dinosaur was not built for bone crushing or fighting.
                The dino seemed more of a scavenger according to its skull. The skull had two rows of seven holes and
                the
                purpose of them is still unknown.
                The Dr thinks that a crown or horn of some type was connected to these holes and held it up.
                They are also suspected of having weak jaws and teeth. The only
                recovered fossil of the dinosaur is the skull.

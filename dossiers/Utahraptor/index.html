            <h4>classification & distribution</h4>
            <p class="superp">
                The Utahraptor, a dinosaur species, roamed the Earth during the Early Cretaceous period, approximately
                135 to 130 million years ago. It inhabited what is now the United States, specifically the region of
                Utah. Evidence of its existence has been found in the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, a site known for
                its diverse ecosystem and paleo-findings, including other dinosaur species like ankylosaurs and
                iguanodonts. It is important to note that the distribution of Utahraptor during its time was limited to
                the areas where its fossils have been discovered. Therefore, given the incomplete nature of the fossil
                record, it is plausible that Utahraptors lived in other regions that have yet to be discovered or
                studied.
            </p>
            <h4>behaviors & adaptations</h4>
            <p class="superp">
                The extinction of the Utahraptor is believed to be caused by the changing environment of the Earth,
                particularly the cooling down of the planet, which the species was unable to adapt to. This is thought
                to be the primary reason for the disappearance of Utahraptors worldwide after a span of around 5 million
                years. The Utahraptor was a large, feathered, actively predatory theropod with warm-blooded
                characteristics. It is speculated that packs of Utahraptors may have lived in forested or desert/prairie
                areas where hunting was abundant. It's worth noting that the question of whether the Utahraptor was
                warm-blooded or cold-blooded is still up for debate, as there is insufficient information to confirm
                either.
            </p>
            <h4>special features & identification</h4>
            <p class="superp">
                The Utahraptor is distinguishable from the famous velociraptor due to its significantly larger size. It
                had a sleek, feathered, bipedal body, with a heavily built, ground-dwelling structure. The Utahraptor
                had a narrow, sharply defined snout and forward-looking eyes. Its jaws contained small, serrated teeth
                that were used to dispatch its prey. The massive raptor also possessed a large "killing claw" on its
                second toe, which it used to capture and kill its prey.

                <h4>who discovered the infamous killer?</h4>
                <p class="superp">The Utahraptor was discovered by Jim Jensen in 1975. However, his initial findings
                    were too fragmented to accurately identify the dinosaur. It wasn't until 1991 that the Utahraptor
                    was fully uncovered during a dig sponsored by the Prehistoric Museum, led by James Kirkland, Robert
                    Gaston, and Donald Burge. All the discoveries were made in Utah, hence the name Utah-raptor. To this
                    day, we continue to make great findings in this dinosaur's ancient history. Games like Jurassic
                    World: The Game and Path of Titans feature this great dinosaur for players to discover and compare
                    its size, providing a fun and interactive way to learn about the Utahraptor.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>predators & prey</h4>
                <p class="superp"> Whether or not the Utahraptor hunted in packs is a topic of debate among researchers,
                    as its large size and fierce nature make it capable of hunting alone. However, many sources and
                    research scientists believe that the Utahraptor did hunt in packs. It is also believed that the
                    species followed a typical Dino-family system, as depicted in movies, such as defending eggs or
                    bringing back food to the nest. As the dominant carnivore in its ecosystem, the Utahraptor ate
                    practically any dinosaur it desired, including Iguanodonts, a large herbivore dinosaur species.</p>

                <h4>what fossil history are we talking about?</h4>
                <p class="superp">James Kirkland, the paleontologist for the state of Utah, named and uncovered the
                    Utahraptor in 1993. In 2018, the Utahraptor was designated as the official state dinosaur. Kirkland
                    hypothesized that the Utahraptors at the Stikes Quarry site got stuck in sinking pits of quicksand
                    while attacking plant-eating dinosaurs that were already trapped there. Their death and submersion
                    in sand is the reason why their bodies were so well-preserved throughout the passing millions of years.</p>

                <p class="superp">In a recent discovery, James Kirkland and a small team successfully removed a massive
                    18,000-pound block of Utahraptor fossils from Stikes Quarry. His latest study includes an updated
                    estimate of the dinosaur's age, which is now believed to be 135 million years old, approximately 10
                    million years older than previously believed.</p>

                    <h4>about breeding and life cycle</h4>
                    <p class="superp">It is believed that Utahraptors lived a life cycle similar to other dinosaurs.
                        They likely started off in an egg and went through an incubation process. The lifespan of a
                        Utahraptor is unclear, with some sources suggesting a range of 70-80 years, while others
                        estimate a little over 20 years. As expected, there are no known special breeding behaviors.
                        However, a recent discovery in the mega block mentioned earlier includes the remains of six
                        Utahraptors, including an adult measuring 16 feet long, four youngsters, and a possible baby
                        Utahraptor measuring only 1 foot long. The mega block's unique preservation of the bodies over
                        millions of years could be a coincidence, but Kirkland believes otherwise and posits that it was
                        a Utahraptor family. This discovery is significant as it could be the start of understanding the
                        behavior of Utahraptors in an unexpected way.</p>

                    <h4>size range & ways our dinosaur communicated</h4>
                    <p class="superp">The Utahraptor was a large dinosaur, weighing over half a ton to a little over a
                        ton, standing 6 feet tall and measuring up to 23 feet in length. It was significantly larger
                        than the famous velociraptor and is believed to have been one of the smartest dinosaurs of all
                        time. The Dromaeosaurs, in particular, were one of the most intelligent groups of dinosaurs ever
                        to exist. This is known because paleontologists use the animal's Encephalization Quotient, or EQ, to
                        determine relative dinosaur intelligence. For reference, an EQ of troodontids is about 6, where dromaesaurs are
                        not far behind with an EQ of 5.8. For a more relative comparison, humans have the highest EQ of
                        7.4-7.8.</p>

                    <h4>other utahraptor species & relative habitatual behaviors</h4>
                    <p class="superp">What's interesting about the Utahraptor is that we have only discovered one
                        species of this dinosaur, known as Utahraptor ostrommaysorum, which means "Utah's predator." The
                        Utahraptor inhabited the plains of North America, specifically floodplains and open woodlands
                        with riverine forests. It was not believed to be very fast, so it likely used cover to lie in
                        wait for prey. Utahraptor packs also likely lived in forests or deserts/prairies where hunting
                        wouldn't be problematic. It is estimated that they had a certain amount of territory, around 3
                        miles all around, which would have been near a water source, suggesting that Utahraptors may
                        have also eaten fish.

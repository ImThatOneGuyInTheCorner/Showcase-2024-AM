                <p>The Erketu is one of the first sauropods found from the Bayan Shireh Formation of Dornogovi,
                    Mongolia. Only one
                    other specimen has been located in Shandong, China.<sup>[<a href="#source2"

                    Its neck was discovered to be two times bigger than the rest of
                    its body, and was
                    also noted to have an unusually short tail for the necessary assumed balance. The discovery of
                    these
                    fossils led to a
                    breakthrough regarding prehistoric muscle functions in the necks of Titanosauriformes. While
                    many
                    palaeontologists had
                    originally believed that these long-necked dinosaurs held their heads vertically (similar to a
                    giraffe), the sheer size
                    of the Erketu challenged the proposed facts. With some further research about better-studied
                    relatives of the Erketu, it
                    became clear that dinosaurs of this size most likely grazed with their necks parallel to the

            <p> The true nature and past of the Erketu is heavily debated by many paleontologists. There are many
                sources with many contradictions. This page attempts to compile the most commonly agreed upon facts.
                Many of the original resources publicised about the Erketu have since been removed from the Web. Some
                details on this page have referenced previous citations of those sources on other websites before
                removal. </p>

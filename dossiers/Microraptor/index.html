            <h2>Size Range</h2>
            <p>The range of height was 2.5 to 3.1 feet, and the weight was less than 3lbs, equal to 1kg.</p>

            <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
            <p>The microraptor was only found in China. It may have resided in forest areas.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <p>The microraptor was the smallest and most birdlike of all dinosaur species. Due to its size, it received its name, which means “small thief” in Greek. According to researchers, most of them were black and glossy, which may have seemed like an iridescence found in peacocks and hummingbirds. As for its small teeth, it was both serrated (sawlike) and non-serrated. It was equipped with long flight feathers on all its 4 limbs and moved with two legs. Although, it is unknown if it can fly or glide.</p>

            <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
            <p>The microraptor would have a carnivorous diet due to its teeth. Here is a list of their prey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mainly, small birds who shared trees</li>
                <li>Reptiles, such as small extinct lizards</li>
                <li>Insects</li>
                <li>Fish</li>

            <h2>Behaviors and Adaptations</h2>
            <p>The microraptor was nocturnal, which meant it was only active at night. It may have glided like a flying squirrel, but it is unsure if it had the capability to fly.</p>

        <section class="box2 fourth">
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>Microraptors were in solitude. They were also in groups. It is unsure how they communicated with each other.</p>

            <h2>Life History Cycle</h2>
            <p>Its life history cycle is not well known. By an adult, it reaches to 2.5-3-1 ft, and weighs less than 3lbs, equal to 1 kg.</p>

        <section class="box2 fourth">
            <h2>Predators</h2>
            <p>The microraptor may have been hunted by the jidapterus, a genus of azhdarchoid pterodactyloid pterosaur. It also would have competed for prey with many similar-sized prehistoric birds.</p>

                <h2>Identification</h2>
                <p>Yinlong is a small dinosaur <sup>[<a href="#source2" title="Wikipedia">2</a>]</sup>
                    reaching 3.9 ft long and having a 22lbs in body mass. Yinlong
                    has a small rostral bone on the end of the
                    upper jaw, identifying Yinlong as a part of
                    the ceratopsian. Yinlong had long robust
                    hind limbs and shorter slender forelimbs
                    with three-fingered hands. The skull has
                    several features, like the squamous bone
                    of the skull roof, which was previously
                    thought to be unique to pachycephalosaurians.</p>

            <h2>Habitat, Feeding & Diet, & Size</h2>
            <p>Yinlong lived in a terrestrial habitat<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Chat GPT">1</a>]</sup>
                which had forests, grassland, desert, shorelines,
                and wetlands. Yinlong’s main diet <sup>[<a href="#source3"
                        title="Yinlong pictures and facts">3</a>]</sup>
                and feeding was aligned with herbivores which consisted
                of plants and foliage. Yinglong’s size was
                on the smaller size for dinosaurs reaching
                the length of 3.9 ft, and having a body
                mass of 22 pounds.

            <h2>Discovery, Distribution, Description, & Fossil Record</h2>
            <p>Xu Xing, Catherine Forster, Jim Clark, and
                Mo Jinyou were a mixed team of American
                and Chinese paleontologists<sup>[<a href="#source2" title="Wikipedia">2</a>]</sup>
                that discovered
                and named Yinlong in 2006. So far
                paleontologists only found one specimen
                of Yinlong in Xinjiang Province, China<sup>[<a href="#source3"
                        title="Yinlong pictures and facts">3</a>]</sup>.
                Yinlong’s fossils record way back to 159
                million to 154 million years ago during
                the Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian stages of
                the Late Jurassic Epoch. Yinlong’s skull
                signified that they were a part of the
                ceratopsian family. Their teeth and limb
                structure gave evidence they were only
                herbivores.</p>

            <h2>Breeding Behavior</h2>
            <p>The breeding behaviors of Yinlong
                are not clear,<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Chat GPT">1</a>]</sup>
                but there are multiple
                ways they could have bred. The first
                one is seasonal breeding as many
                dinosaurs were believed to practice
                seasonal breeding, like many modern
                reptiles and birds. The second would
                be courtship display, because
                ceratopsian dinosaurs were thought to
                have engaged in courtship display.
                Yinlong were known to lay eggs, but
                the exact method of what they do after
                is unknown. Another way could have been
                based on a social structure and their
                complex interactions related to mating
                and protecting their offspring.

            <h2>Time Period Yinlong lived in</h2>
            <p>Yinlong lived in the Late Jurassic
                Epoch<sup>[<a href="#source2" title="Wikipedia">2</a>]</sup>
                , when it was warmer and there
                were no ice caps. Forest and vegetation
                grew close to the poles. The Late
                Jurassic Epoch was also the time
                when Pangaea broke up into two
                supercontinents, Laurasia in the
                North and Gondwana in the south.
                Some examples<sup>[<a href="#source4" title="National History Museum">4</a>]</sup>
                of dinosaurs that lived in the
                same period would be Agilisaurus,
                Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, and many more. </p>

            <h2>Behavior & Adaptations</h2>
            <p>There is little to no information<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Chat GPT">1</a>]</sup>
                about the behavior of the Yinlong
                because so far there is only one
                specimen that has been found by
                paleontologists, but we can make
                educated inferences based on its
                classification as a ceratopsian
                dinosaur. First, it will have a
                herbivorous diet like other
                ceratopsian dinosaurs, because
                of its beak-like structure and
                teeth for grinding plant material.
                Second, they walked on all four
                legs because many ceratopsians
                walked like that for stability
                and support of a herbivorous
                lifestyle. Third, the Yinlong
                has frills and horns most likely
                for defense against predators.
                Fourth, their social behavior most
                likely followed how ceratopsians
                were, where they may have exhibited
                social behaviors similar to modern-day
                herbivorous animals. Living in
                groups or herds for protection

            <h2>Communications & Life History Cycle</h2>
            <p>There is no definite answer<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Chat GPT">1</a>]</sup>
                on how they communicated with each other,
                but they may have used visual
                displays. Using their horns on their
                head may have been one way. Another
                way could be body language. Using
                their body to communicate with each
                other may have been another way
                besides visual display. Another
                three ways of communication can
                be sounds, chemical signals, and
                social behaviors. There is no
                definite lifespan for the Yinlong,
                but smaller dinosaurs tend to have
                shorter lifespans compared to bigger
                dinosaurs. Yinlong’s relative
                the Triceratops were believed to
                have lived for several decades, so
                the educated guess would be several
                years to a couple of decades.</p>

            <h2>Predators</h2>
            <p>Some of Yinlong’s potential predators<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Chat GPT">1</a>]</sup>
                could have been large theropod
                dinosaurs, like Dilophosaurus and
                the Sinraptor. Both dinosaurs were
                carnivores and could have targeted
                smaller dinosaurs like Yinlong.
                Another predator could have been
                raptors, they were small to medium-sized
                theropods. Crocodylomorphs could have
                been predators to Yinlong because
                they were various crocodile-like
                reptiles that lived both in aquatic
                and terrestrial environments. </p>

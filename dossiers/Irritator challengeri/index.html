            <section class="column">
                <p>Throughout all that has been found for irritator
                    fossils, only its skull and some vertebre have been
                    discovered for it. Its skull has a long jaw and snoat used for
                    chaching pray like fish or other animals who can get away
                    easily. The fossil has only been found in south America
                    In one area of Brazil called the Araripe Plateau. The fossil
                    has been founded by a team of people whose names are Martill,
                    Cruickshank, Frey, Small and Clarke in the year 1996. It got
                    its name after its initial discovery when it was given to
                    scientist as a modified skull with parts of other fossils
                    glued to it making it so getting information from the skull
                    was a pain. So its name represented the scientists annoyence
                    with the fossil when trying to get it as it once was.

            <h2>behavoir/adaptation and breeding behavoir</h2>
            <p>The Irritator Challengeri was a very aggresive dinosaur and is a semi-aquatic creature. It can 
                go in the water for long periods of time and will hunt for fish when hungary. It adpated by having 
                a long jaw, abnormal forearms, and long spine which it uses to catch pray like fish or out of reach animals. When it's time for them to breed, 
                use the sails on its back to attract mates so they can reproduce and lay their eggs. It is said they act like 
                crocodiles with their eggs protecting it from large predators so it doesn't get eaten by other animals. Not much
                 is known about how the irritator reproduces but the stuff we have now makes us understand how it lived and 
                 reproduced back then.

                <h2>food and diet</h2>
                <p>The irritator is a carniverous dinosaur feeding off multiple types of animals be it fish,
                    sea turtals, or other dinosaur like pterosuars. These types of animals where easy for the
                    Irritator to catch do to its elongated jaw. The Irritator didn't have to fight muchg to gain
                    It didn't have any known predators where it lived. It could be unchallenged in the food it
                    catches and would not have much compitition in hunting unless if it was from another irritator
                    challengeri.

                <h2>Habitat, life cycle, and its size range</h2>
                <p>The habitat of the irritator was known as a terrestrial habitat which are areas of lakes and 
                    plantations where certain plants or animals lived which were surrounded by areas of dry regions.
                     Irritators start their life by being in an egg like most dinosaurs and  hatch after some time. 
                     The irritator matures quickly and starts to slow down as it becomes an adult with it growing up 
                     to be 3 to 8 meters in length and 2 to 2.5 meters in height. When it's time for mating they use the sails 
                     on its back to attract mates over and they then lay eggs on land where the cycle repeats from there.

        <h2>Fossil record, description, genes, and who found the fossil and when </h2>
        <section class="column">
        <p>The irritators fossil has only been found in one area in the world which was Brazil in South America. 
            Specifically it has been found in the area called Araripe Plateau with only a mostly intact skull and little 
            bits of vertebrae that have been found so far. It was founded by a team of people whose names are Martill, Cruickshank,
             Frey, Small and Clarke in the year 1996. The skull is very similar to another type of dinosaur, the 
             spinosaurus, with it having a long jaw with thin small teeth, having a long snout so it can easily catch 
             pray like fish or small dinosaurs, and vertebrates that could have been used to support a neural spine with 
             either a sail or hump on its back. Its genus is the spinosaurid theropod which makes it in the same genus as 
             other dinosaurs like the spinosaurus and the Angaturama.</p>

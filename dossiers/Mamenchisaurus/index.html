            <h2>About the Mamenchisaurus</h2>
            <p>The Mamenchisaurus is a long-necked sauropod that lived from the late Jurassic to early Cretacious era. That's about 163.5 to 139.8 million years ago! They ate enormous amounts of vegetation in order to allow their giant bodies to function.</p>

            <h2>Size Range and Habitats</h2>
            <p> The Mamenchisaurus family of dinosaurs had various types that were slightly different from each other. The approximate size range of the Mamenchisaurus is about 13 to 35 meters long, or 42.6 to 115 feet long. This would be counting all the different species that make up the different heights. The smallest recorded Mamenchisaurus species was the Mamenchisaurus constructus that measured from 13 to 15 meters long. The largest being the Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum that measured from 26 to 35 meters long.

            <h2>Diet and Identifaction</h2>
            <p>The Mamenchisaurus family is mainly distinguished by its extremely long neck. They generally have approximately 19 vertebrae in its neck to be able to move its neck around a large area of vegetation. This is good for saving the Mamenchisaurus’s energy from walking around with its huge body. The first ever fossils of the Mamenchisaurus was found in 1987 in the Shishugou Formation in Northwest China. The remains were incomplete; however, the lower jaw, some pieces of the skull, and a few vertebrae were found. The vertebrae were very bird-like with about 77% of the volume of it being made up of air.</p>

            <h2>Life History Cycle and Breeding Behaviors</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Mamenchisaurus’ lived in the late Jurassic to the early Cretacious era and lived about 163.5 - 139.8 million years ago. They traveled in small herds and only migrated after they depleted their food supply. They communicated with each other with deep bellows and would send deep notes to other dinosaurs of its species. The Mamenchisaurus reproduces by laying eggs, however, unlike birds, the mamenchisaurus family only produced one egg at a time. These eggs would hatch approximately 65-82 days after being laid. From birth the mamenchisaurus is mostly developed enough to not need to be cared for by their mothers. They eat large amounts of food in order to grow larger than its most prominent enemies. Once they’re bigger than their predators its only aspect limiting their height would be how much food they would eat. It did not have many predators as an adult, its main predators were various Theropod species, when they were still juveniles.

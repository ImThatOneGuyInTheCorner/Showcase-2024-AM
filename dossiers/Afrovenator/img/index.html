            <p>The name afrovenator is a combination of the prefix “Afro” 
                which means from Africa, and the base word venator which means “hunter”.
                The afrovenator has slender bones and sharp teeth. The dinosaur was also a bipedal creature
                meaning it can stand on its hind legs making it an effective predator.<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Dinosaur Facts">1</a>]</sup>

            <h2>Predators and Danger</h2></navtitle>
                <p>Stronger dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus were more dominant
                     and Natural disasters were the main predators.
                      If the afrovenator did hunt alone it would make
                       itself a target towards more dominant dinosaurs.</p>

                <p>Strong hindlegs but small forelimbs. They were expected
                     to run decently fast because of how slim and slender
                      their bones are. Teeth were sharp to cut into prey.
                       Because of their teeth formation we know they didn't
                        use their teeth for plants. Long slender neck with a strong jaw.

        </navtitle>
            <p> It was discovered by Paul Sereno. Found in Niger, Africa.
                 He took an expedition in 1993 to Niger, Africa.
                  They went from Chicago to London to get materials for
                   the expedition then traveled across the Mediterranean by sea.
                    Each bone must be carefully extracted however they didn't have
                     lifting equipment so it had to be pulled out of the ground by hand.
                     The remains were discovered in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation of 
                     the department of Agadez in Niger.<sup>[<a href="#source4" title="Dinosaur Fact">4</a>]</sup> Findings were only ever found in Africa.
                     The dinosaur was expected to be from the early cretaceous era. By late Jurassic pangea had split causing Africa 
                     to be by itself.<sup>[<a href="#source1" title="Dinosaur Fact">1</a>]</sup> Africa at the time was abundant in water and grasslands 
                     which was a problem for any animal. </p>
